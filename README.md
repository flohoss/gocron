[![GitHub go.mod Go version of a Go module](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/gomods/athens.svg)](https://github.com/flohoss/gocron)

A task scheduler built with Go and Vue.js that allows users to specify recurring jobs via a simple YAML configuration file. The scheduler reads job definitions, executes commands at specified times using cron expressions, and passes in environment variables for each job.

## Features

- Simple Configuration: Easily define jobs, cron schedules, and environment variables in a YAML config file.
- Cron Scheduling: Supports cron expressions for precise scheduling.
- Environment Variables: Define environment variables specific to each job.
- Easy Job Management: Add and remove jobs quickly with simple configuration.
- Pre-installed backup-software for an easy backup solution

## How It Works

- Defaults Section: This section defines default values that are applied to all jobs. You can specify a default cron expression and environment variables to be inherited by each job.
- Jobs Section: Here, you define multiple jobs. Each job can have its own cron expression, environment variables, and commands to execute.
- Environment Variables: Define environment variables for each job to customize its runtime environment.
- Commands: Each job can have multiple commands, which will be executed in sequence.

## Docker

### run command

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --name gocron \
  --hostname gocron \
  -p 8156:8156 \
  -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
  # Delete runs from db after x days, disable with -1
  -e DELETE_RUNS_AFTER_DAYS=7 \
  # Log level can be one of: debug info warn error
  -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
  -e PORT=8156 \
  # Check apprise for supported services (https://github.com/caronc/apprise?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-notifications)
  # -e APPRISE_URL=ntfys://{token}@{hostname}/{topics} \
  # one of: debug info warn error
  # -e APPRISE_NOTIFY_LEVEL=warn \
  -v ./config/:/app/config/ \
  # Uncomment if using Restic with a password file
  # -v ./.resticpwd:/secrets/.resticpwd \
  # Uncomment if using a preconfigured rclone config
  # -v ./.rclone.conf:/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf \
  # Uncomment to allow running Docker commands inside the container
